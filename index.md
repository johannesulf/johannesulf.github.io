# About Me

I'm an Astronomy Ph.D. student at [Yale University](http://astronomy.yale.edu/) in New Haven, Connecticut. I work with Professor [Frank van den Bosch](http://campuspress.yale.edu/vdbosch/) on empirically modelling the galaxy-halo connection in large-scale structure surveys. In particular, I am interested in the kinematics of satellite galaxies, galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy assembly bias. Additionally, I'm an active contributor to the open-source [halotools](https://github.com/astropy/halotools) project. The following broad questions drive my research.

* Can the Lamda-CDM cosmological model describe both the results from galaxy surveys as well as observations of the cosmic microwave background?
* Are the dynamics of galaxies consistent with predictions from general relativity?
* What is the relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos? Do current models of galaxy formation correctly predict this relation?
* What are ideal methods to extract information from galaxy surveys in a unbiased and maximally informative way?

Before coming to Yale, I completed my bachelor's degree at the Free University of Berlin. Afterwards, I obtained a master's degree from the University of Heidelberg. I also participated in a half-year exchange program at University of California, Santa Barbara and a one-year exchange program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. From January to June 2017 I was a [Graduate Fellow](http://gsas.yale.edu/news/astronomy-student-wins-fellowship-theoretical-physics-institute) at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP) in Santa Barbara.
