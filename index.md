# About Me

I'm a Stanford--Santa Cruz Cosmology Postdoctoral Fellow. Currently, I spend most of my time in the astronomy department at UC, Santa Cruz working with Professor Alexie Leauthaud. Additionally, I regularly visit Stanford and KIPAC to work with collaborators. I'm a member of the DESI collaboration and also work with data from other large-scale structure surveys like SDSS, HSC and KiDS. The following broad questions drive my research.

* Can the Lamda-CDM cosmological model describe both the results from galaxy surveys as well as observations of the cosmic microwave background?
* Are the dynamics of galaxies as well as the gravitational lensing effect consistent with predictions from general relativity?
* What is the relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos? Do current models of galaxy formation correctly predict this relation?
* What are ideal methods to extract information from galaxy surveys in an unbiased and maximally informative way?

Before coming to UCSC, I completed my bachelor's degree at the Free University of Berlin. Afterwards, I obtained a master's degree from the University of Heidelberg. I also participated in a half-year exchange program at the University of California, Santa Barbara and a one-year exchange program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Additionally, I was a Graduate Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara. Finally, I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of Frank van den Bosch at Yale University.
