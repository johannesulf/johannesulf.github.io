Here, I make data from publications publicly available. If you are interested in my research data and cannot find it here, please reach out to me. I will happily share code and data from published articles.

### Lange et al. (2020, arXiv: 2011.02377)

The data shared here contains all clustering and lensing measurements and covariances as well as posteriors of the galaxy-halo connection model. The results for all three stellar mass estimates are included.
