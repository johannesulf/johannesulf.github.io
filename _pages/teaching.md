# Selected Student Comments

* "By the end of the semester he was providing crucial help and explanations about statistical methods and coding techniques. Without his help I truly would not have passed the class or understood any of what we were trying to accomplish." [Astronomy 356, Astrostatistics and Data Mining, Lab Leader, Spring 2018]
* "Johannes was an absolutely amazing TF. He was always present to provide further assistance, being frequently available to answer questions in his office or after class. His understanding of the subject and of the programming language was very deep, and he would always be patient to sit down and answer questions about lecture material or the problem sets. He was very dedicated, preparing 10 labs to do on Thursday classes, and would always prepare excellent commentary on our problem sets." [Astronomy 356, Astrostatistics and Data Mining, Lab Leader, Spring 2016]
* "As already mentioned, Johannes deserves all the awards at Yale for best TA. He took on the epic problem sets head on and wrote the most comprehensive solutions sets to them. He was always approachable and on hand to clarify questions, was prompt on email and even annotated code and sent it back to us sometimes when we were stuck and at the end of our wits. 11/10, would recommend." [Astronomy 356, Astrostatistics and Data Mining, Lab Leader, Spring 2016]
* "I felt that Johannes was a fantastic TF! His sections were immensely helpful, and once again, I am very thankful for his willingness to stay even after section is over to talk more about specific questions or difficulties I had in understanding problems. The topics he covered in section were always very relevant to our questions, and the way he went over the problems in class were clear and concise. The only suggestion I have would be for, perhaps, more sections? Sometimes I felt like the time went by too quickly, and didn't manage to catch all the details of several solutions." [Astronomy 170, Introduction to Cosmology, Section Leader, Fall 2015]
* "Johannes was an excellent TA. He stuck around after lectures to answer questions, and he was very accessible outside of class as well. He was especially helpful with my final project." [Physics 343, Gravity, Astrophysics, and Cosmology, Grader, Spring 2015]
* "Johnannes was great! He helped us so much when we were trying to do the labs. "[Astronomy 155, Introduction to Astronomical Observing, Lab TA, Fall 2014]
