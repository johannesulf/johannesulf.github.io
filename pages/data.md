Here, I make data from publications publicly available. If you are interested in my research data and cannot find it here, please reach out to me. I will happily share code and data from published articles.

The downloadable data includes all clustering and lensing measurements, covariances, and posteriors of the galaxy-halo connection models for each of the three stellar mass bins.
